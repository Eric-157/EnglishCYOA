            <dt>Timely Regret</dt>
            <dd>Sousou no Frieren is a story about Frieren, an elf who has lived for thousands of years. She is a part of the hero’s
            party that defeated the demon king, and after their decade-long journey, they depart. Given that Frieren lives for so
            long, time flies by in mere instants, and before long, the rest of the hero’s party has grown old and on their
            deathbeds. One of her party members raised a girl as his apprentice in his old age and asks Frieren to raise the girl as
            her apprentice when he passes. It’s during this time, after her party members have passed, that Frieren starts
            reminiscing and starts regretting. So she goes on a journey with her now apprentice to relive her life, to relive her
            journeys. To one day learn what it means to live, to care, to have fun, and to remember the singular points in a very
            long timeline.</dd>
            <dd>So the question is raised. If you had more time, would you utilize it to its fullest? Would you waste your days away, or
            would you make memories? After time has passed, would you still remember those days, or do they not matter to you
            anymore?</dd>
