            <dt>Future</dt>
            <dd>The greatest game designer. That’s what I want to be. Not just good, not just famous. I couldn't care less about fame. I want to be the unquestionable best at what I do. To be 1 in a million. I believe that to be my destiny. My plan is to start a company, nay, a conglomerate. A tech conglomerate. It’d reach into every section of entertainment and computer technology. It would be a game and animation studio, a computer hardware manufacturer and retailer, a streaming service, and a philanthropic entity that strong-arms other companies into supporting their communities. That is my vision, that is my goal. That is my destiny.

            <dd>“Destiny is your mountain, how you choose to walk up this mountain is your free will.“ - <h5>Chubb, Tanaaz. “Destiny and Free Will- How Much of Your Life Is Predetermined?” Forever Conscious, 23 Aug. 2016, <a href="https://foreverconscious.com/destiny-free-will-much-life-predetermined">foreverconscious.com/destiny-free-will-much-life-predetermined</a>.</h5></dd>
            <dd>I’ve always believed destiny to be a predetermined endpoint. The ending has been written, now it’s your job to find the path to it. One could argue that the idea of destiny removes the point of life. If it’s predetermined, there is no point in working hard as you’ll just walk into every opportunity you could have gotten. But I’d argue that you still have the choice to walk to those opportunities or to avoid them. Destiny merely offers you chances to change your path. 
            </dd>
            <dd>So what will you do now? Your paths are laid out before you, it's time to choose. You've already had to choose which sections not to read unless you are rereading this. Time to lose out on more opportunities.</dd>
