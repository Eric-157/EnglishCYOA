            <dd>Re:Zero is a story about a boy who is summoned to another world, and in this world, he has the ability where when he
            dies, time is rewound to checkpoints in the past. Think of Groundhog Day as a comparison. He uses this ability to find
            the best outcome for all of his problems. Painful death after painful death, thousands upon thousands of times.</dd>
            <dd>So the question is raised. If you could repeat parts of your life if you could reset what you’ve done, would you? What
            if that meant something painful. What would you do for a 2nd chance? And what if you could only reset up to a certain
            point. What if something far outside your range of resetting that you had done previously set you up for failure in the
            future. Then what? Your greed for control led you to failure.</dd>
