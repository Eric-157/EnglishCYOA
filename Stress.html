            <dt>Everyone Wants A 2nd Chance</dt>
            <dd>Bokutachi no Remake is a story about a failed game designer. He went to a business school, worked in marketing then got
            into making games in a sudden turn of events. Only this would eventually fall flat and land him back at his parent’s
            home, with no future and no options left. As he went to sleep, he wished for a 2nd chance, a chance to go back and
            follow his dreams. To not play it safe like he had done before. And when he woke up, it was now the past, on the day he
            would have made his college decision. So he chooses to go to art school this time, and the classmates he meets and works
            with turn out to be the very same people he idolizes in the future. But with this 2nd chance, he rewrites history, and
            these people he idolizes are unintentionally screwed over by him being there, taking the spotlight.</dd>
            <dd>So the question is raised. If you had the option for a 2nd chance, would you take it? What if it screwed over other
            people in the process? Would you still do it, knowing that it is now your fault that they don’t succeed?</dd>
