          <h4>Every Journy Starts With The Beginning</h4>
          <dl>
            <dt>Me</dt>
            <dd>I am Eric Edwards. A student at Fitchburg State University. I study both Game Design and Computer Science. I am a vocational school graduate from the Computer Programming trade, and have a 7 year background in robotics. When it comes to my writing, it's very peculiar. A forwarning for any reader beyond this point, it likely won't make sense.</dd>
            <dd>Writing is an art. Every artist is different. I've always been one to hate formatting. That's why you don't see any in this work. If I could describe my art style for writing, I'd describe it as soulful and chaotic. Everything is almost list like, with topics stringing into the next. Simply put, be confused. If you aren't confused or questioning your life choices by the end of this, you didn't read this the way I intended.</dd>
            <dd>So go ahead. Choose your start. Pick your poison. I'll wait. Like literally, I am a webpage, I will wait as long as your device has power.</dd>
