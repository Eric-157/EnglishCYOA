              <ul>
                <li>You shall go west, and face the god who has turned,</li>
                <li>You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned,
                </li>
                <li>You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend,
                </li>
                <li>And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.

            <dd>One of my all-time favorite book series is a story about the gods, Greek, Roman, Norse, Egyptian, and many more. Percy Jackson is a very well-known series, and given its recent Disney+ adaptation, you have probably heard of it at least once before. The story follows Percy, the son of Poseidon, and his quests that will alter the fate of the world. These quests are dictated by prophecies, much like the one above. Spoiler warning, with the prophecy above, everything comes true. Percy and the gang go west to California and find that Ares had turned though they suspected it was Hades at first. They found what was stolen, both the Lightning Bolt and the Helm of Darkness. They were betrayed by their friend Luke at the end of the story, and Percy failed to save his mother and to save Luke from turning evil.

            <dd>Prophecies are tricky. The future even when set in stone can be blurry. What you think will happen may only be a partial truth. Using Percy Jackson still as an example, take the Great Prophecy for example.

              <ul>
                <li>A half-blood of the eldest gods</li>
                <li>Shall reach sixteen against all odds</li>
                <li>And see the world in endless sleep</li>
                <li>The hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap</li>
                <li>A single choice shall end his day</li>
                <li>Olympus to preserve or raze.</li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dd>Percy was the half-blood of the eldest gods who reached the age of sixteen, and he was the one who watched the world in endless sleep from the workings of the god Hypnos. But for the rest of it, the prophecy was talking about Luke, the traitor, and it wasn’t known until the events happened. “The hero’s soul, cursed blade shall reap” did not refer to Percy being killed by Kronos, it referred to Luke killing himself with his own sword backbiter, killing Kronos who was using Luke’s body as a vessel. Thus making Luke the hero who preserved Olympus. Because of everyone’s dispositions towards the prophecy, when Percy was discovered to be the son of Olympus, everyone had expectations. The Greek gods and demi-gods on the side of the gods expected Percy to save everyone single-handedly, as per the prophecy. Kronos and the other Titans expected Percy to turn sides and help them raze Olympus.</dd>
            <dd>And while reality does not have all mighty beings waging a war over the sole power of the world, our world does have something similar. Expectations. What the future will look like, the downsides to the future, and what has to be done to get to that point. For me, to be the greatest game designer requires to be famous, otherwise, you're not the greatest. But I don’t want fame. It just is a necessary evil I will learn to live with.
