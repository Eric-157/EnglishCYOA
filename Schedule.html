            <dt>A Downward Spiral</dt>
            <dd>My schedule is a hotpot overfilled, flowing over the sides and burning those who touch it. I’ve simply just grown
            accustomed to the burning. 2 majors, 3 minors, 2 jobs, 1 club, soon to be 3. With that comes winter and summer classes
            and summer jobs to pay off the extra costs of taking these classes. Extra classes each semester, meetings for clubs, and
            work that takes up more time. And of course, there are other responsibilities, volunteer work, and a personal life. Take
            all of that into account of regular people's things that people do. Eat food, sleep, use the bathroom, skin care (if you
            do it). I also like to take walks to force myself to have some free time to look after my mental health. So where’s the
            time of the day to be free of the schedule? To be free of the stress? There are 24 hours a day, 1440 minutes. 10080
            minutes in a week, or 168 hours. 12 hours and 45 minutes of that is dedicated to physical class time. I work at least 9
            hours a week, spend on average (when splitting up the total amount of studying spent over a week into day to day) 2
            hours a day on studying or doing homework, meaning 14 hours. That’s now 35 hours and 45 minutes. I sleep on average 7
            hours a day, so 49 hours a week. I also eat for about an hour and 20 minutes each whole day, so that’s 9 hours and 20
            minutes. That’s now 94 hours and 5 minutes. Add in about 6 hours a week for bathroom time considering showers can take a
            while with hair care, so that’s now 100 hours and 5 minutes, breaching the triple digits. Now add about 13 hours every
            week from walking, some of which is required, some of which is extra, and add 3 hours and 30 minutes a week for Improv.
            Now it’s 116 hours and 35 minutes out of 168 hours. Add 1 hour for skin care per week, add 4 hours per week for DND, add
            about 15 hours a week for social interactions because it’s healthy to have social interaction, and now I’m at 136 hours
            and 35 minutes. And just for the sake of redundancy, I’ll add another 14 hours a week, so 2 hours a day of things
            unaccounted for, things I don’t think about because it’s autopilot. Everyone has those, everyone is so enamored with
            their schedule that they won’t notice the small things. For example, I will often spend a few minutes a day rubbing my
            fingers on my fingernails or picking at calluses on my fingertips. A few minutes a day will be spent playing with my
            hair or trying to not doze off from not having enough sleep some days. All of those small things add up. Meaning I’ve
            got 150 hours and 35 minutes a week, effectively scheduled. Leaving me with 17 hours and 25 minutes over 1 week of free
            time. That is effectively 170 minutes, or 2.85 hours of free time a day when rounding. What do I do with just 3 extra
            hours a day? Sleep more? Some days I do. Should I study more? Do more homework? Sure, sometimes. Other times that extra
            time is eaten up by meetings or by my other obligations that don’t happen every week that I couldn’t include in the
            total number. So then when do I really get a break? If we’re playing the number games here, the numbers aren’t adding up
            to a whole lot of time for rest and relaxation.
