            <dd>Raise your hand if you overwork yourself. 🖐️I know I do. Why is overworking oneself so decorated? At what point is it hard work and at what point is it self-harm? America’s culture around overwork is gross. Take, for example, the game design industry since I can accurately portray it. 12-hour work days, sometimes longer, with minimal breaks. Leading up to and upon a game's release, this could sometimes get longer. It’s an abusive industry that I’ll be going into. So why is it oversaturated? Why do so many people want to go into this industry? What about all of the other industries with similar workplace values? Is it really worth the acclaim that you are working hard? The risks are so extraordinarily high that it doesn’t seem worth it. Cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stress, higher chance to smoke, consume alcohol and being physically inactive, lack of sleep, and having a higher risk of injury. There are likely many other health problems that could arise. But these are the problems proven to be directly linked to overwork by the team with the NCBI.
